# 🛡️ LLM Shield Backend

An **AI-powered security platform** designed to protect **Large Language Model (LLM)** applications from **prompt injection attacks** using intelligent honeypot technology and real-time threat detection.

> 🚀 Built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) — with a planned migration to [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for integration with the core Python security engine.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **LLM Shield Backend** acts as a **secure and intelligent API gateway** that:
- Detects and classifies malicious or injected prompts in real time.
- Redirects suspicious traffic to interactive **LLM honeypots** for behavioral analysis.
- Logs and stores attacker interaction data for deeper threat intelligence.
- Communicates with a Python-based decision engine to generate adaptive responses.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Prompt Injection Detection** — machine learning–powered real-time analysis.  
- 🐝 **Intelligent Honeypots** — dynamic interaction and data collection from attackers.  
- 🔐 **Secure API Gateway** — authentication, authorization, and access control.  
- 📊 **Centralized Logging** — full visibility of suspicious activity and patterns.  
- ⚡ **Modular Architecture** — built with NestJS, easily extendable and scalable.
